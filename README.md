### Introduction to BTR

BTR was created to change the way readers both post and read reviews. 

Our unique rating system promotes users to share more than just another biased review and be as objective as possible.  

BTR is a spoiler free zone, where all book connoisseurs can come together to share and browse through an insightful collection of reviews.
